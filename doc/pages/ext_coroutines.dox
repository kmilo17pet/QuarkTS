* @section q_qcoroutines_overview Overview
* A task coded as a Co-Routine, is just a task that allows multiple entry points
* for suspending and resuming execution at certain locations, this feature can 
* bring benefits by improving the task cooperative scheme and providing a linear
* code execution for event-driven systems without complex state machines or full
* multithreading.

* <em>Coroutines in QuarkTS</em>
* </center>
* 
* The QuarkTS implementation uses the Duff's device approach, and is heavily
* inspired by the Knuth method, <a style="font-weight:bold" href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html">Simon Tatham's Co-Routines in C</a>
* and <a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://dunkels.com/adam/pt/index.html">Adam Dunkels Protothreads</a>
* . This means that a local-continuation variable is used to preserve the current
* state of execution at a particular place of the Co-Routine scope but without 
* any call history or local variables. This brings benefits to lower RAM usage, 
* but at the cost of some restrictions on how a Co-routine can be used.
*
* <b> Limitations and restrictions </b>
*
* - The stack of a Co-Routine is not maintained when a yield is performed. This
* means variables allocated on the stack will loose their values. To overcome 
* this, a variable that must maintain its value across a blocking call must be 
* declared as @c static.
* - Calls to API functions that could cause the Co-Routine to block, can only 
* be made from the Co-Routine function itself - not from within a function
* called by the Co-Routine.
* - The implementation does not permit yielding or blocking calls to be made from
* within a @c switch statement.
*
* @section q_coroutine_code Coding a Co-Routine
* The application writer just needs to create the body of the Co-Routine . This
* means starting a Co-Routine segment with #qCR_Begin and end with #qCR_End 
* statement . From now on, yields and blocking calls from the Co-Routine scope 
* are allowed.
*
*  @code{.c}
*  void CoroutineTask_Callback( qEvent_t e ) {
*      qCR_Begin {
*          if ( EventNotComing() ) {
*              qCR_Yield;
*          }
*          DoTheEventProcessing();
*          qCR_Delay( WAIT_TIME_S );
*          PerformActions();
*      } qCR_End;
*  }
*  @endcode
*
* The #qCR_Begin statement should be placed at the start of the task function 
* in which the Co-routine runs. All C statements above the #qCR_Begin will be 
* executed as if they were in an endless-loop each time the task is scheduled.
*
* A #qCR_Yield statement return the CPU control back to the scheduler but saving
* the  execution progress, thereby allowing other processing tasks to take place
* in the system. With the next task activation, the Co-Routine will resume the
* execution after the last #qCR_Yield statement.
*
* @note Co-Routine statements can only be invoked from the scope of the 
* Co-Routine.
* @remark Do not use an endless-loop inside a Co-routine ,this behavior it's 
* already hardcoded within the segment definition.
*
* @section q_coroutine_blocking Blocking calls in a Co-routine
* Blocking calls inside a Co-Routine should be made with the provided
* statements, all of them with a common feature: an implicit yield.
*
* A widely used procedure is to wait for a fixed period of time. For this, the 
* #qCR_Delay should be used. This statement makes an apparent blocking over the
* application flow, but to be precise, a yield is performed until the requested 
* time expires, this allows other tasks to be executed until the blocking call 
* finish. This "yielding until condition meet" behavior its the common pattern 
* among the other blocking statements.
*
* Another common blocking call is #qCR_WaitUntil. This statement takes a 
* condition argument, a logical expression that will be performed when the 
* Co-Routine resumes their execution. As mentioned before, this type of 
* statement exposes the expected behavior, yielding until the condition is met.
*
* An additional wait statement #qCR_TimedWaitUntil is also provided. This one
* sets a timeout for the logical condition to be met, with a similar behavior 
* of #qCR_WaitUntil.
*
* Optionally, the Do-Until structure gives to application writer the ability to 
* perform a multi-line job before the yield, allowing more complex actions to
* being performed after the Co-Routine resumes:
*
*  @code{.c}
*  qCR_Do {
*      /* Job : a set of instructions*/
*  } qCR_Until( Condition );
*  @endcode
*
* @section q_coroutine_example1 Co-Routine usage example
*
*  @code{.c}
*  void Sender_Task( qEvent_t e ) {
*      static qSTimer_t timeout;
*      qCR_Begin {
*          Send_Packet();
*          /* Wait until an acknowledgment has been received, or until
*           * the timer expires. If the timer expires, we should send
*           * the packet again.
*           */
*          qSTimer_Set( &timeout, TIMEOUT_TIME );
*          qCR_WaitUntil( PacketACK_Received() || qSTimer_Expired(&timeout));
*      } qCR_End;
*  }
*  /*===================================================================*/
*  void Receiver_Task( qEvent_t e ) {
*      qCR_Begin {
*          /* Wait until a packet has been received*/
*          qCR_WaitUntil( Packet_Received() );
*          Send_Acknowledgement();
*      } qCR_End;
*  }
*  @endcode
*
* @section q_coroutine_positions Positional jumps
* This feature provides positional local jumps, control flow that deviates from 
* the usual Co-Routine call.
*
* The complementary statements #qCR_PositionGet and #qCR_PositionRestore provide
* this
* functionality. The first one saves the Co-Routine state at some point of their 
* execution into @c CRPos, a variable of type @ref qCR_Position_t , that can be used
* at some later point of program execution by #qCR_PositionRestore to restore 
* the Co-Routine state to the one saved by #qCR_PositionGet into CRPos. This 
* process can be imagined to be a "jump" back to the point of program execution 
* where #qCR_PositionGet saved the Co-Routine environment.
* 
* @section q_coroutine_semaphores Semaphores
* This extension implements counting semaphores on top of Co-Routines. 
* Semaphores are a synchronization primitive that provide two operations: @a wait 
* and @a signal. The @a wait operation checks the semaphore counter and blocks 
* the Co-Routine if the counter is zero. The @a signal operation increases the 
* semaphore counter but does not block. If another Co-Routine has blocked 
* waiting for the semaphore that is signaled, the blocked Co-Routines will
* become runnable again.
*
* Semaphores are referenced by handles, a variable of type qCR_Semaphore_t and 
* must be initialized with #qCR_SemInit before any usage. Here, a value for the
* counter is required. Internally, semaphores use an @c uint32_t to represent 
* the counter, therefore the value argument should be within range of this 
* data-type.
* 
* To perform the |a wait operation, the #qCR_SemWait statement should be used. 
* The wait operation causes the Co-routine to block while the counter is zero. 
* When the counter reaches a value larger than zero, the Co-Routine will 
* continue.
* 
* Finally, #qCR_SemSignal carries out the @a signal operation on the semaphore. 
* This signaling increments the counter inside the semaphore, which eventually 
* will cause waiting Coroutines to continue executing.
*
* @section q_coroutine_example2 Co-Routine example with semaphores.
* The following example shows how to implement the bounded buffer problem using
* Co-Routines and semaphores. The example uses two tasks: one that produces items
* and other that consumes items.
*
* Note that there is no need for a mutex to guard the @c add_to_buffer() and 
* @c get_from_buffer() functions because of the implicit locking semantics of 
* Co-Routines, so it will never be preempted and will never block except in an 
* explicit #qCR_SemWait statement.
* 
*  @code{.c}
*  #include "HAL.h"
*  #include "QuarkTS.h"
*  #include "AppLibrary.h"
*  
*  #define NUM_ITEMS    ( 32 )
*  #define BUFSIZE      ( 8 )

*  qCR_Semaphore_t mutex, full, empty;
*  /*===================================================================*/
*  void ProducerTask_Callback( qEvent_t e ) {
*      static int produced;
*      
*      qCR_Begin {
*          for ( produced = 0 ; produced < NUM_ITEMS ; ++produced ) {
*              qCR_SemWait( &full );
*              qCR_SemWait( &mutex );
*      
*              add_to_buffer( produce_item() );
*        
*              qCR_SemSignal( &mutex );
*              qCR_SemSignal( &empty );
*          }
*      } qCR_End;
*  }
*  /*===================================================================*/
*  void ConsumerTask_Callback( qEvent_t e ) {

*      
*      qCR_Begin {
*          for ( consumed = 0 ; consumed < NUM_ITEMS ; ++consumed ) {

*              qCR_SemWait( &mutex );
*

*              qCR_SemSignal( &mutex );
*              qCR_SemSignal( &full );
*          }
*      } qCR_End;
*  }
*  /*===================================================================*/
*  void IdleTask_Callback( qEvent_t e ) {
*      /*nothing to do*/
*  } 
*  /*===================================================================*/
*  int main(void) {
*      HAL_Init();
* 
*      qOS_Setup( HAL_GetTick, 0.001f, IdleTask_Callback );
*      qCR_SemInit( &empty, 0 );
*      qCR_SemInit( &full, BUFSIZE );
*      qCR_SemInit( &mutex, 1 );
*      
*      qOS_Add_Task( &ProducerTask, ProducerTask_Callback,
*                    qMedium_Priority, 0.1, qPeriodic, qEnabled, NULL );
*      qOS_Add_Task( &ConsumerTask, ConsumerTask_Callback,
*                    qMedium_Priority, 0.1, qPeriodic, qEnabled, NULL );
*      qOS_Run();
*      return 0;
*  }
*  @endcode
*
* @section q_coroutine_ext External control
* In certain situations, it may be necessary to control the flow of execution 
* outside of the segment that defines the Co-routine itself. This is typically 
* done to defer or resume the Co-routine in response to specific occurrences 
* that arise in other contexts, such as tasks or interrupts.
*
* To address these specific scenarios, a handler for the Co-routine must be 
* defined, which is a variable of type @ref qCR_Handle_t. Additionally, to 
* initiate the scope of the target Co-routine, the statement #qCR_BeginWithHandle 
* should be used instead of #qCR_Begin.
* 
*  @code{.c}
*  qCR_Handle_t xHandleCR = NULL; /*NULL initialization are strictly necessary*/
*  
*  /*===================================================================*/
*  void AnotherTask_Callback( qEvent_t e) {
*      int UserInput = 0;
*      if ( e->FirstIteration ) {
*          qCR_ExternControl( xHandleCR, qCR_RESUME, 0 );
*      }
*      if ( e->LastIteration ) {
*          qCR_ExternControl( xHandleCR, qCR_SUSPEND, 0 );
*      }
*      UserInput = GetTerminalInput( );
*      if ( UserInput == USR_RESTART ) {
*          qCR_ExternControl( xHandleCR, qCR_RESTART, 0 );
*      }
*      Perform_AnotherTask_Activities();
*  }
*  /*===================================================================*/
*  void CoroutineTask_Callback( qEvent_t e ) {
*      qCR_BeginWithHandle( xHandleCR ) { /*externally controlled*/
*          if ( EventNotComing() ) {
*              qCR_Yield;
*          }
*          RunFirstJob();
*          qCR_Delay( WAIT_TIME );
*          SecondJobStatus = RunSecondJob();
*          qCR_TimedWaitUntil( JobFlag == JOB_SUCCESS, JOB_TIMEOUT );
*          CleanUpStatus = CleanupJob();
*          qCR_WaitUntil( SomeVar > SomeValue );
*      } qCR_End;
*  }
*  @endcode
*
* As shown in the code snippet above, the Co-routine handle its globally declared
* to enable other contexts to access it. The example demonstrates  how  another 
* task can control the Coroutine using the qCR_ExternControl() API. It's 
* important to note that the actions performed by this API can only be effective
* after the handle instantiation, which is a one-time operation that occurs 
* during the first call of the Co-routine.
*
* @note A @c NULL initialization its mandatory on @ref qCR_Handle_t variables. 
* Undefined behavior may occur if this step is ignored.
