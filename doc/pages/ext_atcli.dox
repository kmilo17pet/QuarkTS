* @section q_atcli_overview Overview
* A command-line interface (CLI) is a way to interact directly with the software 
* of an embedded system in the form of text commands and responses. It can be 
* seen as a typed set of commands to produce a result, but here, the commands 
* are typed in real-time by a user through a specific interface, for example, 
* UART, USB, LAN, etc.
*
* A CLI is often developed to aid initial driver development and debugging. This 
* CLI might become the interface (or one of the interfaces) used by a 
* sophisticated end-user to interact with the product. Think of typing commands
* to control a machine, or perhaps for low-level access to the control system as 
* a development tool, tweaking time-constants and monitoring low-level system 
* performance during testing.
* 
* @section q_atcli_components The components of the CLI
* The provided development API parses and handles input commands, following a 
* simplified form of the extended AT-commands syntax.

* <em>AT CLI implementation</em>
* </center>
* 
* As seen in figure, the CLI has a few components described below:
*
* - <b>Input Handler</b> : It is responsible for collecting incoming data from 
* the input in the form of ASCII characters inside a buffer. When this buffer is
* ready by receiving an EOL(End-Of-Line) byte, it notifies the validator to 
* perform the initial checks.
* - <b>Validator</b> : Take the input string and perform three checks over it:
*   -# The input matches one of the subscribed commands.
*   -# The input matches one of the default commands.
*   -# The input is unknown
* - <b>Pre-Parser</b> : Takes the input if the validator asserts the first check.
* It is responsible for syntax validation and classification. Also, prepares the
* input argument for the next component.
* - <b>Callback or Post-Parser</b> : If input at the pre-parser is valid, the 
* respective command callback is invoked. Here, the application writer is free 
* to handle the command execution and the output response.
* - <b>Output printer</b> : Takes all the return status of the previous 
* components to print out a response at the output.
* 
* @remark Here, @a Input and @a Output should be provided by the application 
* writer, for example, if a UART interface is chosen, the input should take 
* the received bytes from an ISR and the output is a function to print out a 
* single byte.
*
* @section q_atcli_syntax Supported syntax
* The syntax is straightforward and the rules are provided below:
*
* - All command lines must start with AT and end with an @c EOL character. By 
* default, the CLI uses the carriage return character. (We will use @c CR to 
* represent a carriage return character in this document).
* - AT commands are case-insensitive
* - Only four types of AT commands are allowed:
*     - Acting (::qATCLI_CMDTYPE_ACT) : This is the simplest type of commands 
*     that can be subscribed. Its normally used to execute the action that the 
*     command should do. This type does not take arguments or modifiers, for 
*     example : @c AT+CMD
*     - Read (::qATCLI_CMDTYPE_READ) : This type of command allows you to read 
*     or test a value already configured for the specified parameter. Only one 
*     argumentis allowed. for example @c "AT+CMD?" or @c "AT+CMD?PARAM1"
*     - Test (::qATCLI_CMDTYPE_TEST) : These types of commands allow you to get
*     the values that can be set for its parameters. No parameters are allowed 
*     here. Example @c "AT+CMD=?"
*     - Parameter Set (::qATCLI_CMDTYPE_PARA) : These types of commands allow 
*     n arguments to be passed for setting parameters, for example: @c AT+CMD=x,y
*  If none of the types is given at the input, the command response will be 
*  @c ERROR
* - The possible output responses are:
*     - @c OK: Indicates the successful execution of the command.
*     - @c ERROR: A generalized message to indicate failure in executing the command.
*     - @c UNKNOWN : The input command its not subscribed.
*     - <tt>NOT ALLOWED</tt> : The command syntax is not one of the allowed types.
*     - User-defined: A custom output message defined by the application writer.
*     - @c NONE : No response.
*
* All responses are followed by a @c CR @c LF
*
* Errors generated during the execution of these AT commands could be due to the
* following reasons:
* - Incorrect syntax/parameters of the AT command
* - Bad parameters or not allowed operations defined by the application writer.
*
* In case of an error, the string @c ERROR or @c "ERROR:<error_no>" are displayed.
*
* @section q_atcli_setup Setting up an AT-CLI instance
* Before starting the CLI development, the corresponding instance must be 
* defined; a data structure of type @ref qATCLI_t. The instance should be 
* initialized using the qATCLI_Setup() API.
*
* @section q_atcli_sub_commands  Subscribing commands to the parser
* The AT CLI is able to subscribe any number of custom AT commands. For this, the
* qATCLI_CmdSubscribe() API should be used.
*
* This function subscribes the CLI instance to a specific command with an associated
* callback function, so that next time the required command is sent to the CLI input,
* the callback function will be executed. The CLI parser only analyzes commands that
* follow the simplified AT-Commands syntax already described.
*
* @section q_atcli_cmd_callback Writting a command callback
* The command callback should be coded by the application writter. Here, the 
* following prototype should be used:
*
*  @code{.c}
*  qATCLI_Response_t CMD_Callback( qATCLI_Handler_t h ) {
*      /* TODO : The command callback */
*  }
*  @endcode
* 
* The callback takes one argument of type @ref qATCLI_Handler_t and returns a 
* single value. The input argument it's just a pointer to public data of the CLI
* instance where the command it subscribed to. From the callback context, can be
* used to print out extra information as a command response, parse the command 
* parameters, and query properties with crucial information about the detected
* command, like the type, the number of arguments, and the subsequent string 
* after the command text. To see more details please check the 
* @ref qATCLI_Handler_t struct reference.
*
* The return value (an enum of type @ref qATCLI_Response_t) determines the 
* response shown by the Output printer component. The possible allowed values are:
*
* - ::qATCLI_OK : as expected, print out the OK string.
* - ::qATCLI_ERROR : as expected, print out the ERROR string.
* - ::qATCLI_ERROR_CODE(no) : Used to indicate an error code. This code is 
* defined by the application writer and should be a value between @c 1 and 
* @c 32766. For example, a return value of @c QATCLI_ERROR_CODE(15), will print 
* out the string @c ERROR:15.
* - ::qATCLI_NORESPONSE : No response will be printed out.
* 
* A simple example of how the command callback should be coded is showed below:
*
*  @code{.c}
*  qATCLI_Response_t CMD_Callback( qATCLI_Handler_t h ) {
*      qATCLI_Response_t Response = qATCLI_NORESPONSE;
*      int arg1 = 0;
*      float arg2 = 0;
*      /*check the command-type*/
*      switch ( h->Type ) {
*          case qATCLI_CMDTYPE_PARA:
*              if ( h->NumArgs > 0 ) {
*                   arg1 = h->GetArgInt( 1 ); /*get the first argument as integer*/
*                   if ( h->NumArgs > 1 ) {
*                       arg2 = h->GetArgFlt( 2 ); /*get the second argument as float*/
*                       sprintf( h->Output, "arg1 = %d arg2 = %f", arg1, arg2 );
*                       Response = qATCLI_NORESPONSE;
*              }
*              else {
*                   Response = qATCLI_ERROR;
*              }
*              break;
*          case qATCLI_CMDTYPE_TEST:
*              h->puts( "inmediate message" );
*              Response = qATCLI_OK;
*              break;
*          case qATCLI_CMDTYPE_READ:
*              strcpy( h->Output , "Test message after the callback" );
*              Response = qATCLI_OK;
*              break;
*          case qATCLI_CMDTYPE_ACT:
*              Response = qATCLI_OK;
*              break;
*          default:
*              Response = qATCLI_ERROR;
*              break;
*      }
*      return Response;
*  }
*  @endcode
*
* @section q_atcli_inputh Handling the input
* Input handling is simplified using the provided APIs. The qATCLI_ISRHandler() 
* and qATCLI_ISRHandlerBlock() functions are intended to be used from the 
* interrupt context. This avoids any kind of polling implementation and allows 
* the CLI application to be designed using an event-driven pattern.
*
* Both functions feed the parser input, the first one with a single character 
* and the second with a string. The application writer should call one of these
* functions from the desired hardware interface, for example, from a UART 
* receive ISR.
*
* If there are no intention to feed the input from the ISR context, the APIs 
* qATCLI_Raise() or qATCLI_Exec() can be called at demand from the base context.
* As expected, both functions send the string to the specified CLI. The 
* difference between both APIs is that qATCLI_Raise() sends the command through
* the input, marking it as ready for parsing and acting as the Input handler 
* component. 
*
* The qATCLI_Exec(), on the other hand, executes the components of Pre-parsing 
* and Postparsing bypassing the other components, including the Output printer, 
* so that it must be handled by the application writer.
* 
* @note All functions involved with the component Input-handler, ignores 
* non-graphic characters and cast any uppercase to lowercase.
*
* @section q_atcli_run Running the CLI parser
* The parser can be invoked directly using the qATCLI_Run() API. Almost all the 
* components that make up the CLI are performed by this API, except for the 
* Input Handler, that should be managed by the application writer itself.
*
* In this way, the writer of the application must implement the logic that leads
* this function to be called when the input-ready condition is given.
*
* The simple approach for this is to check the return value of any of the input 
* feeder APIs and set a notification variable when they report a ready input. 
* Later in the base context, a polling job should be performed over this 
* notification variable, running the parser when their value is true, then 
* clearing the value after to avoid unnecessary overhead.
*
* The recommended implementation is to leave this job be handled by a task 
* instead of coding the logic to know when the CLI should run. For this, the 
* qOS_Add_ATCLITask() is provided. This API add a task to the scheduling scheme
* running an AT Command Line Interface and treated as an event-triggered task. 
* The address of the parser instance will be stored in the @c TaskData 
* storage-Pointer. 
*
* After invoked, both CLI and task are linked together in such a way that when 
* an input-ready condition is given, a notification event is sent to the task
* launching the CLI components. As the task is event-triggered, there is no 
* additional overhead and the writer of the application can assign a priority 
* value to balance the application against other tasks in the scheduling scheme.
*
* @section q_atcli_example1 A CLI example
* The following example demonstrates the usage of a simple command-line interface
* using the UART peripheral with two subscribed commands :
* - A command to write and read the state of a GPIO pin @c "at+gpio".
* - A command to retrieve the compilation timestamp @c "at+info".
* First, lets get started defining the required objects to setup the CLI instance:
*
*  @code{.c}
*  #define CLI_MAX_INPUT_BUFF_SIZE         ( 128 )
*  #define CLI_MAX_OUTPUT_BUFF_SIZE        ( 128 )
*  
*  qTask_t CLI_Task;
*  qATCLI_t CLI_Object;
*  qATCLI_Command_t AT_GPIO, AT_INFO;
*  
*  char CLI_Input[ AT_CLI_MAX_INPUT_BUFF_SIZE ];
*  char CLI_Output[ AT_CLI_MAX_OUTPUT_BUFF_SIZE ];
*  
*  /*Command callbacks*/
*  qATCLI_Response_t AT_GPIO_Callback( qATCLI_Handler_t h );
*  qATCLI_Response_t AT_INFO_Callback( qATCLI_Handler_t h );
*  @endcode
*
* Then the CLI instance its configured by subscribing commands and adding the task
* to the OS. A wrapper function its required here to make the UART output-function
* compatible with the CLI API.
*
*  @code{.c}
*  void CLI_OutputChar_Wrapper( void *sp, const char c ) { /*CLI output function*/
*      (void)sp; /*unused*/
*      HAL_UART_WriteChar( UART1, c );
*  }
*  /*==================================================================*/
*  int main( void ) {
*      HAL_Setup();
*      qOS_Setup( HAL_GetTick, TIMER_TICK, NULL );
*      qATCLI_Setup( &CLI_Object, BSP_UART_PUTC, CLI_Input, sizeof(CLI_Input), 
*                    CLI_Output, sizeof(CLI_Output) );
*      
*      qATCLI_CmdSubscribe( &CLI_Object, &AT_GPIO, "at+gpio", AT_GPIO_Callback, 
*                           QATCLI_CMDTYPE_ACT | QATCLI_CMDTYPE_READ | 
*                           QATCLI_CMDTYPE_TEST | QATCLI_CMDTYPE_PARA | 0x22, NULL );
*      qATCLI_CmdSubscribe( &CLI_Object, &AT_INFO, "at+info", AT_INFO_Callback, 
*                           QATCLI_CMDTYPE_ACT, NULL );
*      qOS_Add_ATCLITask( &CLI_Task, &CLI_Object, qLowest_Priority );
*      qOS_Run();
*  
*      return 0;
*  }
*  @endcode
*
* The CLI input its feeded from the interrupt context by using the UART receive
* ISR:
*
*  @code{.c}
*  void interrupt HAL_UART_RxInterrupt( void ) {
*      char received;
*      
*      received = HAL_HUART_GetChar( UART1 );
*      qATCLI_ISRHandler( &CLI_Object, received ); /*Feed the CLI input*/
*  }
*  @endcode
*
* Finally, the command-callbacks are later defined to perform the requested 
* operations.
*
*  @code{.c}
*  qATCLI_Response_t AT_GPIO_Callback( qATCLI_Handler_t h ) {
*      qATCLI_Response_t RetValue = qATCLI_ERROR;
*      int pin, value;
*     
*      switch ( h->Type ) {
*          case qATCLI_CMDTYPE_ACT: /*< AT+gpio */
*              RetValue = qATCLI_OK;
*              break;
*          case qATCLI_CMDTYPE_TEST: /*< AT+gpio=? */
*              h->puts( "+gpio=<pin>,<value>\r\n" );
*              h->puts( "+gpio?\r\n" );
*              RetValue = qATCLI_NORESPONSE;
*              break;
*          case qATCLI_CMDTYPE_READ: /*< AT+gpio? */
*              sprintf( h->Output, "0x%08X", HAL_GPIO_Read( GPIOA ) );
*              RetValue = qATCLI_NORESPONSE;
*              break;
*          case qATCLI_CMDTYPE_PARA: /*< AT+gpio=<pin>,<value> */
*              pin = h->GetArgInt( 1 );
*              value = h->GetArgInt( 2 );
*              HAL_GPIO_WRITE( GPIOA, pin, value );
*              RetValue = qATCLI_OK;
*              break;
*          default : break;
*      }
*       
*      return RetValue;
*  }
*  /*==================================================================*/
*  qATCLI_Response_t AT_INFO_Callback( qATCLI_Handler_t h ) {
*      qATCLI_Response_t RetValue = qATCLI_ERROR;
*     
*      switch ( param->Type ) {
*          case qATCLI_CMDTYPE_ACT: /*< AT+info */
*              strcpy( h->Output, "Compilation: " __DATE__ " " __TIME__ );
*              RetValue = qATCLI_NORESPONSE;
*              break;
*          default :
*              break;
*      }
* 
*      return RetValue;
*  }
*  @endcode
