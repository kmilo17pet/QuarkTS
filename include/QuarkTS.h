/** @mainpage QuarkTS OS
* An open-source OS for small embedded applications.

*
* QuarkTS is an operating system that provides a modern environment to build
* stable and predictable event-driven multitasking embedded software. The OS is
* built on top of a cooperative quasi-static scheduler and its simplified kernel
* implements a specialized round-robin scheme using a linked-chain approach and
* an event-queue to provide true FIFO priority-scheduling.
*
* <b>Features:</b>
*
* - Prioritized cooperative scheduling.
* - Time control (Timed tasks and software timers)
* - Inter-Task communication primitives, queues, notifications and event-flags.
* - State-Machines ( hierarchical support )
* - Co-routines.
* - AT Command Line Interface (CLI)
*
* QuarkTS is developed using a formal and rigorous process framed in compliance
* of the MISRA-C-2012 and CERT coding standard guidelines and complemented with
* multiple static-analysis checks targeted to safe critical applications.
*
* <b>Why cooperative?</b>
*
* Rather than having preemption, tasks manage their own life-cycle. This bring
* significant benefits, fewer re-entrance problems are encountered, because
* tasks cannot be interrupted arbitrarily by other tasks, but only at positions
* permitted by the programmer, so you mostly do not need to worry about pitfalls
* of the concurrent approach (resource-sharing, race-conditions, deadlocks,
* etc...).
*
* <b>What is it made for?</b>
*
* The design goal of QuarkTS is to achieve its stated functionality using a
* small, simple, and (most importantly) robust implementation to make it
* suitable on resource-constrained micro-controllers, where a full-preemptive
* RTOS is an overkill and their inclusion adds unnecessary complexity to the
* firmware development. In addition with a state-machines support, co-routines,
* time control and the inter-task communication primitives, QuarkTS provides a
* modern environment to build stable and predictable event-driven multitasking
* embedded software. Their modularity and reliability make this OS a great
* choice to develop efficiently a wide range of applications in low-cost
* devices, including automotive controls, monitoring and Internet of Things.
*
* <b>Why should I choose it?</b>
*
* QuarkTS is not intended to replace o compete with the other great and proven
* RTOS options already available today, for example FreeRTOS or MicroC/OS-II,
* in fact, you should check these options first. However, due to its size and
* features, is intended to play in the space between RTOSes and bare-metal.
* QuarkTS was written for embedded developers who want more functionality than
* what existing task schedulers offer, but want to avoid the space and
* complexity of a full RTOS, but keeping the taste of a robust and safe one.
